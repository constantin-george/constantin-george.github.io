I am a PhD student in the Biology Department at the University of Florida. I am a studying the evolution of aging in [Professor Karen Bjorndal's lab](https://biology.ufl.edu/bjorndal/). I am also a member of the [Archie Carr Center of Sea Turtle Biology](https://accstr.ufl.edu/)

My main research interest is in reproductive biology and foraging ecology of sea turtles, particularly the intersection between the two.
