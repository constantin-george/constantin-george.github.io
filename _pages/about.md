I am a doctoral student in the Biology Department at the University of Florida. I am studying the evolution of aging in [Professor Karen Bjorndal's](https://biology.ufl.edu/bjorndal/) lab. I am also a member of the [Archie Carr Center of Sea Turtle Biology](https://accstr.ufl.edu/). I hold a M.Sc. in wildlife conservation from [Trinity College Dublin](https://naturalscience.tcd.ie/postgraduate/msc-biodiversity/).

I currently research life-history theory and reproductive senescence in sea turtles, and I am particularly interested in the intersection between foraging ecology and the rate of aging. I approach my research through a statistical framework. 

While, for the most part, my focus has been on sea turtles, I am deeply interested in population modeling and its application to conserving fragile ecosystems and threatened species. I feel by understanding the underlying mathematics of biological systems you gain a deeper insight into the nuts and bolts of how these systems function.

I have worked in various roles on multiple projects, both governmental and non-governmental, around the world. These include [ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece](https://www.archelon.gr/index_eng.php), [Reef HQ, The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium](https://www.reefhq.com.au), and the [Sea Turtle Conservancy](https://conserveturtles.org).
