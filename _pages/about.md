I am a PhD student in the Biology Department at the University of Florida. I am studying the evolution of aging in [Professor Karen Bjorndal's](https://biology.ufl.edu/bjorndal/) lab. I am also a member of the [Archie Carr Center of Sea Turtle Biology](https://accstr.ufl.edu/). I have an MSc in conservation from [Trinity College Dublin](https://naturalscience.tcd.ie/postgraduate/msc-biodiversity/), where my thesis was focused on developing statistical models to explain the effect of ecotourism on nesting green turtles at Tortuguero, Costa Rica.

My main research interest is in life-history theory and reproductive senescence in sea turtles, particularly the intersection between the two. I approach my research through a statistical framework, working to develop models to explain aging and the consequences of such. Sea turtles provide a fascinating study system given their longevity and complex life-history.  

Prior to starting a PhD in 2017, I have worked on multiple projects, both governmental and non-governmental, around the world. These include [ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece](https://www.archelon.gr/index_eng.php), [Reef HQ, The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium](https://www.reefhq.com.au), and the [Sea Turtle Conservancy](https://conserveturtles.org).
